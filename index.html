BUGS TO FIX:
* Linking an existing controller will not work as navigation binds are not set before buttonAssign is called
* Calling new CmxBook will not create a controller because it will attempt to add CmxCtrl element via insertAdjacentElement, before the CmxBook itself is added to the DOM
* closure-compiler fucks up class names: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12105424
* include source map
* include counter number
